CannonML
====
CannonML (Cannon Macro Language) provides a Flash shmups pattern generator represented in very very short text.  
[Nomltest on Flash](http://wonderfl.net/c/alru) is the best example what CannonML can do.

This is a port of Keim's great CannonML to Haxe.

At the moment, most everything works to the point where NomlTest works!
